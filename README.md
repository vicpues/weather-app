This was an assignment for The Odin Project's Web Dev course. The goal was to implement a call to a third-party API into a real website. At the same time, I used several build tools to improve load times and developer experience. I also implemented a linting workflow for the first time, to keep formatting consistent and avoid mistakes. Finally, I decided to switch to vanilla CSS for this project, as opposed to SCSS. To keep some of their features and backward compatibility, I added PostCSS to the build.

## Technologies used

-   Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS
-   Webpack build tools (Babel, MiniCssExtract, post-css...)
